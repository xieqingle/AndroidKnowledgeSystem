# The Future of Mobile App Development

### Foreword

Anxiety means nothing. The best way is to move on! right now!

### The direction moving forward

#### 1. Cross-platform

Cross-platform development changes the way of mobile development, blurred the line of Web and Client.      
And let more and more people know the advantage of it. At present, there r three mainstream solutions:

1. React-Native Bridge concept which embeds the Apple JavaScriptCore(V8)
2. WebView Core customized by different companies, H5 Containerization
3. Flutter

#### 2. Machine Learning

TensorFlow launched new mobile framework,and more and more apps are deployed machine learning model on mobile. 

#### 3. AR & VR

Currently, most of the application for AR is advertising monetization. Other application scenario is explored continuously. If u r research OpenGL or computer graphics, u can pay close attention on AR engine. It has a bright future. 

So does VR.

#### 4. Audio & Video

Why is mobile technology so important: 
1. One of the most import source to get information is vison.
2. Mobile network infrastructure is no more the bottleneck. Because of data can be transfered extremely fast by Mobile. 
3. So much required that user needs about video apps, we can't ignore it.
4. New technology make video content more various, such as encoding and decoding technology and pattern recognition. 

Almost everyone has some video-audio apps on their smart phone, so professional developers in video-audio fields r needed urgently. Lots of technical knowledges of video-audio need to be applied in some professional field, such as image processing, filter, video clip. There will be so much advantages if u have a great research on OpenGLï¼Œcomputer graphics.


#### 5. Blockchain

Currently, digital wallet is the mainly application of blockchain for mobiles. There will be much more applications in the future.

#### 6. Basic framework

Basic framework r necessary for every app. The apps won't run correctly without them, such as internet request, log-handle, dao, cache and push.

#### 7. Tool apps

Developing tool apps test the depth of Android knowledge very much, such as phone guardian.
