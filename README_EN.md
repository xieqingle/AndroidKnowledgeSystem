# TheMostCompleteAndroidKnowledgeSystemAndRealStuff

The most complete Android advanced route knowledge map + dry goods data collection you want, It can help you to solve the problem of "leak checking - > search data - > special study - > fix short board" in one go.

# 一、Why does the project exists?

I believe that we often encounter confusion when we study:

- Perplexity 1: there are so many materials and blog posts on the Internet, which are dazzling and unsystematic. There are too many hydrological and copy paste articles, and the workload of screening is too large. How can I **find the article I want quickly and well**?
- Perplexity 2: there are a lot of materials, but I can't learn how to go in, isn't it the right way? How to learn this knowledge? How can I **improve my learning methods**?

So I have the idea of writing an advanced knowledge map of Android. There are systems, directions and materials. You can either sort them out as a whole or find out and fill in the gaps. **If you are an Android newcomer, not good at searching or don't know how to start new knowledge points, then I believe this list will become your first choice.

**The project will be continuously updated.**

Of course, due to personal level, please correct any mistakes. For a problem, you have better tips. Welcome to raise an issue or pr. please grow up with me. Welcome to maintain this project!

**If this project can help you even a little bit, please star! Your encouragement is my greatest motivation for writing! **
